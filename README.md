# Sensorized Underactuated Finger (SUF) 
Underactuated Finger for Proprioceptive Tactile Sensing
This page presents the design of a new sensorized underactuated self-adaptive finger. This design incorporates a two-degrees-of-freedom (DOF) link-driven underactuated mechanism with an embedded load cell for contact force measurement and a trimmer potentiometer for acquiring joint variables. The utilization of proprioceptive (i.e., internal) sensors results in tactile-like sensations in the finger without compromising the size and complexity of the proposed design. To obtain an optimum finger design, the placement of the load cell is analyzed using Finite Element Method (FEM). The design of the finger features a particular rounded shape of the distal phalanx and specific size ratio between the phalanxes to enable both precision and power grasps.
